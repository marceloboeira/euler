// Project Euler: Challenge 002 - http://projecteuler.net/problem=2

// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
// By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
// find the sum of the even-valued terms.

// Answer: 4613732

var a = 0,
	b = 1,
	limit = 4000000,
	result = 0;

while (a <= limit) {
	if (a % 2 == 0) {
		result += a;		
	}
	
	temp = a;
	a = b;
	b = temp + b;
}

console.log(result);
